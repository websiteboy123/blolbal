    <h2>Introduction to Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Climate change is caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect are indeed useful in our planet Earth. They reflect 40% of the heat coming from the sun. However, there are bad sides of greenhouse effect. That is called enhanced greenhouse effect. They cause bad air pollution, ice melts, and ocean level rises. Also, the air is getting warmer because of climate change. Examples of enhanced greenhouse effect are burning fossil fuels</p>

    <h2>Importance of learning Cimate Change</h2>
    <p>â€”Learning about climate change is imperative for raising awareness about its causes, impacts, and potential solutions. Armed with this knowledge, individuals and communities can take meaningful action to mitigate its effects, advocate for policy changes, and build resilience against its impacts. Understanding climate change also enables us to address its health implications, economic opportunities, and environmental challenges, paving the way for a more sustainable future. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to promoting renewable energy and sustainable practices, informed action is key to tackling one of the most pressing issues of our time and ensuring the well-being of both people and the planet.</p>

    <h2>How to prevent Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>Conserve Energy-

    --> Minimize the amount of energy you use for heating and cooling, convert to energy-saving electric appliances. Up to 900 kg of CO2e can be removed from your home's carbon footprint annually by increasing its energy efficiency.
    --> Turning off the lights when not really needed and using sunlight as an alternative, unplugging appliances when they are not in use, and walking instead of driving are all cases of preserving the energy that helps in reducing the demand on the earth's natural resources. </p>
    <p>-Take Care of Your Surroundings-

    --> Help in cleaning your environment. One of the ways for this is to dispose your trash properly. 
    Land and water contamination caused by poorly disposed trash truly affects humans, animals, plants and as well as the environment that may leads in contribution to the causes of climate change. 
    --> If you have yourself with some free time, try participating in local cleanup activities in your own community that aims to safeguard green spaces, waterways, and other natural areas.</p>
    
    <p>-Reject, Reduce, Re-use, Repair, Recycle-

    --> Following these 5R concept can help to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, lower greenhouse gas emissions, save energy, and reduce trash to landfills. These methods help to make the environment healthier and more sustainable by reducing the environmental impact of the increasing waste production.</p>

    <p>LET'S KEEP IN MIND:

        - Encourage others to understand that rather than only discussing this significant matter, we should all take concrete actions to even at least lessen its burden. 
        - Aside from increasing and spreading awareness about this matter, the people we intend to educate and inspire will be more encouraged if they see that we are really doing things or taking steps to prevent climate change. It's like a domino effect whereby if one person takes action, it might lead others to follow similarly. 
        - It might possibly be an effective way to start from simple things and work your way up to larger goals, especially when there is a strong sense of unity among all the individuals, a huge improvements is possible!</p>
